            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> Many Web Developers use Version Control while working on new projects. Version control is one main repository for all of the project files. If web developers are working as a team, this makes it easy for them to review files, change files, and more. This serves as an advantage because developers are able to work much more efficiently with this sharing system. This topic interested me because last assignment, I discussed information about Cloud Computing. Version Control is similar in its own unique way by allowing multiple individuals to access a file. Cloud computing allows individuals to access finals from anywhere, and for teams to share as well.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">GIT is a form of a version control system available for web developers to use. GIT is a free control system that can be used as a server. Developers can use GIT on a variety of projects, small and large. Large technology companies such as Google and Facebook use GIT to their advantage. It is awesome that our class is able to use a program that top companies are using as well. In the future, students can use this understanding in their careers. This topic is also interesting to me because it relates back Cloud9, the program we will be using through the entirety of our course.

                <span class="text-muted">GIT Commands</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead"> When using GIT, you are able to use GIT commands. GIT commands are helpful because they able to change things by simple commands in the repository. For example, in assignment 3, I was able to use a few in the Cloud9 terminal to connect my Cloud9 account to GitHub. One GIT command that is helpful is “git status” which is used to check the state of a project. By using commands, web developers are able to monitor and change aspects of their projects. GIT commands are similar to other commands we use in the Cloud9 terminal. They are also similar to commands used in Object Oriented Programming. This topic interests me because Cloud9 is able to use a variety of commands from different version control systems.

                <span class="text-muted">Local Repository</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Local Repository is a repository that resides on a local machine of an individual user. This is the repository that individuals can make local changes on and it is typically located on a computer. There are two ways to create a local repository. One way is by creating a new repository or by cloning a repository. Users are able to use GitHub to move files from their Local Repository to their Remote Repository. This topic connects back to our course because web developers are able to use repositories when they use GitHub. Repositories are assets to web developers and are a key part of version control systems.

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A Remote Repository is a repository that resides on a remote server that is shared among multiple developers working on a project. This repository is able to hold original files and edited versions of the files. This gives team members an advantage to access a variety of files whilst working on projects. Remote Repositories are shared through URL format. For example, there are HTTPS URL’s and SSH URL’s. On Cloud9, we used a SSH URL from GitHub during one point of assignment 3. This topic relates to our course because we will be using GitHub (which uses repositories) in combination with Cloud9.
