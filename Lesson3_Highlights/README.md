## Lessons Learned in the Assignment:
1. One concept we learned about was how to connect GitHub, a devlopment platform, to Cloud9.
2. Another lesson I learned was that you must follow Git commands precisely or they will not work in the terminal.
3. I also learned that there are many version control systems out there and they contain local and remote repositories.
